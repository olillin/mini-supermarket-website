                    Mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                    Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to
                    signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
                    online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
                    stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and
                    implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do
                    not
                    currently respond to DNT signals or any other mechanism that
                    automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
                    online.
                    If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
                    follow
                    in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a

                <p>
                    California law requires us to let you know how we respond to
